# In-Class + Homework Exercise Guess Who Game SI 
# Julia Les 5/17/2016 (In-Progress)

# Create a "Guess Who" game.
# Your goal is to correctly identify the guilty suspect. 
# You should have multiple classes.  
# It should show a list of the suspects and the user is
# prompted to choose an attribute of hair color, eye color, 
# skin color, or gender. If guilty suspect doesnâ€™t match 
# the trait entered then remove the suspects of that trait.
# The number of name guesses cannot exceed 3 per player.
# Should be playable by two players from the terminal.

# Utilizes information contained in suspects.csv
