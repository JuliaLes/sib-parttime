# In-Class + Homework Exercise Guess Who Game SI 
# Julia Les 5/17/2016 (In-Progress)

# Create a "Guess Who" game.
# Your goal is to correctly identify the guilty suspect. 
# You should have multiple classes. You have 3 chances. 
# It should show a list of the suspects and the user is
# prompted to choose an attribute of hair color, eye color, 
# skin color, or gender. 
# If guilty suspect doesnâ€™t match the trait entered
# then remove the suspects of that trait.

# Utilizes information contained in suspects.csv

# TODO: complete the program
