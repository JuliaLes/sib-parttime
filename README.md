Projects for Startup Institute Ruby Part-time Course April-June 2016.

My capstone project for this course was the blackjack program, which 
allows the user to play a game of blackjack in the terminal with an
AI dealer. 

Other projects include a league point calculator and "Guess Who" 
game, which can also be utilized from the terminal.
